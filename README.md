## Multi-Modal Transformer for Sarcasm Detection in Film

This repository contains the implementation of my master thesis: Multi-Modal Transformer for Sarcasm Detection in Film. 
It includes all necessary code to run the model on your local device.

## Dataset

The transformer approache has been trained and evaluated on the [MUStARD++](https://github.com/cfiltnlp/MUStARD_Plus_Plus) dataset, which contains sarcastic and non-sarcastic video clips from popular American sitcoms. The MUStARD++ is a reworked dataset by [Anupama Ray](https://aclanthology.org/2022.lrec-1.756.pdf) and originates from Santiago Castro's [MUStARD](https://github.com/soujanyaporia/MUStARD) dataset.
