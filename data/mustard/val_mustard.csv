Oh, I, uh, I didn't think I was going to get to see you until tomorrow. Yeah, well, Bernadette's a little under the weather and my mom's kind of under my dentist."
2_486,2_486_u,0," Oh my! They're male nurses. Not in my head. Anyway, they want to take us out Saturday night! What do you say?"
1_S09E01_027,1_S09E01_027_u,1," So, what package are you thinking? Mm, this one comes with music and flowers. Oh, they even stream the whole thing live on the Internet. Why would we want that? Cause there's a lot of gorgeous blondes out there who don't believe they can land a short, nearsighted scientist. Let's give them hope. Whatever. Put us on the Internet. I've always wanted a wedding with a comment section."
3_S01E02_461,3_S01E02_461_u,0," I'm awake! I'm awake. - What? - No, no, I wasn't. I was sleeping. I'm sorry for sleeping and for lying about it."
1_S12E04_204,1_S12E04_204_u,0," - Tam Nguyen? - Yeah. Yes. Is my son done with his tour? No idea. We're actually friends of Sheldon Cooper. Oh, I've been trying to get in touch with him, but I never heard back. Is he okay?"
1_S10E01_075,1_S10E01_075_u,1," When Beverly gets here, do not bring up last night. All right? As far as you're concerned, you didn't see anything. I want you just to play dumb. It was nice of her to show us playing dumb with an example."
1_12320,1_12320_u,0," Okay. Well, then it's settled: small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies. Sounds perfect. Great. You still didn't pick a date. Stay out of it! Shut up! Oh, yes, we've got the moon and the trees and... Elizabeth McNulty, who apparently died when she was the same age I am."
2_400,2_400_u,0," I know, it is isn't it? No, I mean it, this feels really good. Is it a hundred percent cotton? Yeah! And I got it on sale, too. Anyway, I should go, one of the lifeguards was just about to dismantle a nuclear device."
1_S12E23_209,1_S12E23_209_u,1,"  Hey, fellas. Can you do me a favor? Do we have a choice? Ha-ha! No. Sheldon and Amy are now officially superstars, and the press will be reaching out to their family and friends for comment. So that we're all on the same page, the word we're gonna use to describe them is ""quirky."" And not quirky. More like quirky. So not Mr. and Mrs. Wackadoodle?"
1_11889,1_11889_u,0," Hi. Hello. Oh, and a special hello to Leonard, who needs to be mentioned by name. Subtle. But you got it, right? Hey, guys. Hey. Hi. Hello. I just want everyone to know, uh, tonight's not a sad occasion. Yeah, we just want to have the kind of dinner that we've all had here so many times before."
1_11885,1_11885_u,1," Glad you guys could make it. Of course. Wow, it looks really pretty in here. Yeah, turns out half a dozen menorahs really sets a mood."
1_11243,1_11243_u,1," Yeah. Tell me those aren't the words of a man with a spider eating its way through his brain. Amy, you're a neuroscientist.
Crack his skull open, spray some Raid in there. I love that you take pride in your looks, even when I have to pee in the morning, and you're in there spending an hour on your hair. I love that you're too good to pee in the kitchen sink."
1_5751,1_5751_u,0," What the hell is wrong with you?! Well...
You were always so nice to me, I thought maybe you liked me. I'm nice to everyone! I'm sorry. Damn right, you're sorry! And you tell Howard there's never been anything between us! I will. Hey, Bernadette? What?! Do you think I have a shot with Penny? Of course you do. You're a cutie pie! Any girl would be lucky to have you!"
1_S11E08_005,1_S11E08_005_u,0," Can we start the movie? Before Sheldon gets here? Last time we did that, he didn't talk to us for a month. So do it! Hold on. Where is he? Well, according to his text, he was on the second floor, then he stopped to tie his shoe."
1_11201,1_11201_u,0," It's nice they're getting exercise. Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt. I'm sure he brought it. No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it. He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast. Look, there's an entire section of my dashboard that doesn't have any syrup on it."
