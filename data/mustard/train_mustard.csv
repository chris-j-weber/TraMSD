1_7575,1_7575_u,1.0,"  It was a compromise. I lost. Can you believe Stuart's walking around taking credit for this party? Who cares? What do you mean ""who cares""? Look at what I pulled off here.
The deejay's on fire, there's a Tardis photo booth in the back room, and, oh, my God, the food! Stuart wanted Kraft Draculoni and cheese. You're right, the party's fantastic. Please, tell me more. I haven't heard enough about it all week because hearing about that never gets old!"

She tried, he said no. - Well, then she should fire him. - She can't fire him. Why not? She fired me. Exactly. She can't fire him because she fired you.

1_3069,1_3069_u,0.0,"  Am I correct in assuming that your attempt to be accepted by Penny's peers is based on your desire to ensure your continuing mating privileges with her? Well, I wouldn't put it exactly that way. How would you put it? Yeah, okay, like you said. Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through for intercourse."

We all know the reason. Sheldon, what are you getting at? That woman looks exactly like the pictures of Princess Panchali in the book.

None of the girls at work like me enough to get me a gift. Okay, so you'll know why everyone at the office has the same handwriting. I really appreciate the thought, but it's not necessary.

How can she have dinner? Fine, whatever. 
Priya will be having breakfast. All right, so technically it's not a dinner date. I suppose you could call it a, uh, dinfast date. But if you did, you'd open yourself to peer-based mocking, such as, ""Hey, Leonard, how was your dinfast with Priya last night?"""

I thought there were only three projects in contention. There were. But, at the last minute, someone submitted an application for a pretty cool europium-doped laser, and they made a very compelling case. What was the case?"
1_2354,1_2354_u,1.0,"  They're here. Stay calm. We don't know anything about them yet. What are you doing? I'm checking for musical instruments. Does that sound like castanets to you? The box says ""kitchen."" So? Do cocaine smugglers write ""cocaine"" on the box?"

Apparently, Halley's afraid of the dark now and I can't turn on the night-light cause it makes Michael cry. Why doesn't he like the night-light? Jot that down, we can ask him as soon as he learns to speak. We can also find out what's so damn funny about birds. I'll go talk to her. I don't know why she's suddenly so afraid of everything.

1_11773,1_11773_u,1.0,  we decided that the time was right to take a step forward. Okay. Do you want to say it? Let's say it together. We're getting a turtle! This is why I've been saying we should keep champagne on ice.
2_410,2_410_u,1.0,"  That's funny. Who are they? The blond woman is my ex-wife, and the woman touching her is her... close, personal friend. You mean they're lovers. If you wanna put a label on it."

Which makes for a great commute. Home, work, home. I'm still working-- I'm just working from home. You know, if it's that easy, then why does Leonard have to drive you to work every day?"

You doing okay? Oh, I'm fine.
It's just her I'm worried about. Aw, she'll be okay.
She's a grown woman. I know. 
It's just ever since my dad left, I've felt responsible for her. That's a lot for a kid to deal with. She was just so sad all the time. Yeah, I was the only person who could cheer her up. Well, me and Ben and Jerry."

1_7593,1_7593_u,0.0,"  What do you think? Can I speak to you for a second? I'll be right back. Feel free to play with yourself. I don't care for your friend, he's being rude to me. You need to ask him to leave. Amy, I can't just ask Wil Wheaton to leave. He's a minor celebrity. Once you explain who he is, many people recognize him."

1_3766,1_3766_u,1.0,"  I honestly don't care. Really? Because every time we've talked about unusual animal genitals, you've always had some pretty strong and controversial opinions. What do you want from me? I just don't give a rat's ass. Would that be a giant rat's ass? For the record, giant rats are possible. Can we please talk about something else? Maybe something vaguely related to life as we know it on this planet?"

1_8746,1_8746_u,1.0,"  So what'd you think? It was good. That's it? ""Good""? I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me "" Raiders of the Lost Ark "" for the first time."
2_392,2_392_u,1.0,  Because I met somebody who would be perfect for you. Ah you see perfect might be a problem. Had you said co-dependent or self-destructive.

1_2198,1_2198_u,1.0,"  See, by attaching RFID tags to my clothing, it will enable my laptop to read and identify the items with this wand. I will then cross-reference them against destination, anticipated activity spectrum, weather conditions, duration of trip, et cetera. That does sound much simpler. How long is this going to take? Assuming I can keep up this pace, three hours, 11 minutes. Plus however long it takes to conclude this fairly pointless conversation."
1_S12E12_371,1_S12E12_371_u,1.0,"  Really? Zack wanted you to donate your genetic material for his baby? Yeah. So I'd be helping out a couple who really want a baby, and they were gonna pay us, and Penny freaked out about it. That doesn't make any sense. I know. They wanted you?"

I was thinking about how I let you down. Yeah. But if I had known what kind of friend you would turn out to be, I wouldn't have worried about it so much. See you around! Wait! Just wait one second. There has to be something that I can do, something. If we still had that entertainment unit, I would get in there for six hours and think about  how I let you down. We got a box."

1_S12E06_248,1_S12E06_248_u,1.0,  What do you think you're doing? I thought it was clear. I'm being unnecessarily hurtful but with a sweet voice. And I don't understand what's going on because I went to MIT.
1_S09E07_135,1_S09E07_135_u,1.0,"  Look, I don't even think you can take this wall down 'cause it's load-bearing. Well, it's easy to find out, just go into the crawlspace under the house and check. When is your visa up?"
2_112,2_112_u,1.0,"  I just want to go back to my cell, cause in my cell I can smoke. Smoke away! I think this is probably why Damone smokes in his cell alone."

Joey' trailer took advantage of me No way, I have been going to the guy for twelve years Oh c'mon, he said he was gonna do my inseam, then he ran his hand, up my leg and then there was definite What?

3_S03E04_437,3_S03E04_437_u,0.0,"  Well, what you did took incredible guts. And the fact that it probably won't make any difference makes it all the more meaningful. Right, I saw this nature documentary where a bison fought a lion to protect the rest of the herd. And it was so moving.

1_11253,1_11253_u,0.0,"  Who will stand between us and flag ignorance"""" I know I was thinking that.
Is this a show on flags or mind reading? But the truth is I can no longer balance a full-time career, a popular Internet show, and a girlfriend. And he really does have one, you jerks on the comment board. So as they say, all good things must come to an end."

1_8452,1_8452_u,1.0,"  Probably because I didn't read the instructions.
No wrapper's going to tell me what to do. Unless his name is Jay-Z. Is something going on? What do you mean? Well, you're acting all weird.
And I'm pretty weird, so I think I know what I'm talking about. I don't know. Maybe it's all those steroids I've been taking. I think I'm gonna go. Thank you for the burrito and the pork rinds and the 20-minute lecture on why monster trucks are better than regular trucks."

1_3545,1_3545_u,1.0,"  There's a 39.95 lover's special at P.F. Chang's. Egg rolls, dumplings, bottomless wok, and you get your picture taken on the big marble horse out front. Given that Saint Valentine was a third century Roman priest who was stoned and beheaded, wouldn't a more appropriate celebration of the evening be taking one's steady gal to witness a brutal murder?

A career I chose in no small part because it's indoors, but if I'm able to detect slow-moving magnetic monopoles there, I will be the scientis to confirm string theory.

1_8749,1_8749_u,1.0,"  I enjoyed it. When you told me I was going to be ""losing my virginity,"" I didn't think you meant showing me Raiders of the Lost Ark  for the first time. My apologies. I chose my words poorly.
I should have said you were about to have your world rocked on my couch. Anyway, thank you for watching it.

1_2853,1_2853_u,1.0,"  My God, she didn't! What could she possibly be talking about for so long? Obviously, waitressing at The Cheese Cake Factory is a complex socio-economic activity that requires a great deal of analysis and planning."

(laughs) And best of all, you can't use the Internet to cheat. Because we locked you out of your Wi-Fi, and the answer to this is your new password. I'm no longer happy."
2_315,2_315_u,1.0,"  So. I just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit. I mean, you know, we've never really talked. I guess you'd know that, being one of the two of us, though, right?"

1_6766,1_6766_u,0.0,"  And I'm super smart, so it's probably true. Hey, I've been training in the field of neurobiology for 12 years. You've been here for three hours, and you've spent one of them in the bathroom. I'm sorry! It takes me a while to get things going on an unfamiliar toilet. Sheldon, I've given you the simplest things to do, and you haven't done one of them right. Maybe that's because I'm not being challenged. It's the same reason Einstein failed math."
1_3287,1_3287_u,1.0,"  I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner. Sure. The more, the merrier. Wa- no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating. Sheldon... Don't ""Sheldon"" me. We ordered for five people, not six. Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style. Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
3_S02E04_395,3_S02E04_395_u,0.0,"  Okay, that was the third reference she's made to how much money she's making. Hmm. That's a $3500 bag. How do you know? You have the same one? No, I have the fucking Internet. You don't think she's making more money than us, do you? No, we all have equalized pay, remember?"
2_542,2_542_u,1.0,"  Well, I'm just,if the paste matches the pants, you can make yourself a pair of paste pants and she won't know the difference! Joey, do you have a minute? Dude, what am I gonna Uh, Rachel's here, so good luck man, let me know how it works out."

1_11901,1_11901_u,1.0,"  I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. 
It's all about the execution. Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic.
What's more important, an idea or its execution? Oh, that's fun. Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago.

Let's just think different. Uh, don't think different. That's Apple. Let's just... Let's just do it. - That's Nike, man. - I know that's Nike. - Yeah. - Uh... Fuck it. I don't know. Let's just make it... Let's make it happen. Yeah, agreed. To his beneficence."
1_S10E10_009,1_S10E10_009_u,1.0,"  If we're going to be staying in this apartment, would you be interested in doing a little redecorating? Oh, actually, I would. Great, what'd you have in mind? Let's take every single thing from the other apartment and put it in here. Well, how about we start a little smaller? Like moving the furniture around. You know, I have always thought that this couch would look fantastic on the curb in front of the building."
2_71,2_71_u,1.0,"  Oh so pretty, this must have cost him a fortune. Oh c'mon Ross, remember back in college when he fell in love with Carol and bought the ridiculosly expensive crustal duck?

1_11322,1_11322_u,1.0,"  Hey, how are things going with your parents? Not great. They hired divorce attorneys. You know, speaking of attorneys, if I ever needed a lawyer, I would not hire She-Hulk. You know what? That was almost on topic. I'm gonna say, ""Good job, Sheldon."""
2_13,2_13_u,0.0,"  Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. Why? Do you have the answers written on there? No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me. All right, let's do it."

1_9971,1_9971_u,1.0,"  We can't show up to your mom's empty-handed. 
We should bring something. I already am.
I'm bringing the gift of knowledge. Oh, boy. Despite what her Bible says, recent archeological studies indicate that although camels are referenced in the Old Testament, they didn't exist in the Middle East until hundreds of years later. I was gonna say we pick up a cake or a pie. But an insult to her faith is always thoughtful."
1_S09E23_420,1_S09E23_420_u,1.0,"  To be honest, I'm surprised you cared about the wedding at all. I'm still human, Penny. Not getting invited to my own son's wedding is difficult to ignore. I know how you feel. She didn't invite any of us. It was spur of the moment! But we did get to see a live stream of it on the Internet. I could've watched it on the Internet? Thank you."
2_500,2_500_u,1.0,  I want to show you something too. You know those big road signs that say Merge? So I was thinking that we could get one fo those signs and hang it over the bed. Because its you and I together - Merge! Oh my God I love that! - Really? - NO!

What can we do to help him? Well, grieving is a process. Every culture has its own rituals and traditions to facilitate mourning. The ancient Egyptians had their mummification, the Tibetans had their sky funerals... And when I was little and my dog died, my mom sat me down and very gently told me that she wished the truck had hit my dad instead."

No. Sheldon and Amy are now officially superstars, and the press will be reaching out to their family and friends for comment. So that we're all on the same page, the word we're gonna use to describe them is ""quirky."" And not quirky. More like quirky. So not Mr. and Mrs. Wackadoodle?"

He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator. That is amazing.
How long have you been collecting? Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn't really get serious until William Shatner's bladder infection. What'd you get? What'd you get? Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it's pretty cool."
1_9245,1_9245_u,0.0,"  Yes. And some people in the science community are calling it ""The Wonder Blunder."" Who? Give me their names.
I bet it's Wolowitz. It's just such a fascinating story. Your calculations are way off, but they find the element anyway. It's like misreading a treasure map and still finding the treasure. Can we talk about something else? Do you know that I yodel?"
2_448,2_448_u,0.0,  Yeah! You gotta tell a girl before you tape her. Such a rookie mistake. Y'know who has a great video camera? Greg and Jenny? Do you still wanna call  'em? I wanna call  'em.
1_11177,1_11177_u,1.0,"  Okay, why? I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it."

Yeah, building on your premise, Leonard could frequent sushi bars, salad bars, oyster bars, the Apple Genius Bar... What are you doing? Keep going. I'm listening. That was rude. He does it all the time. He's a cornucopia of social awkwardness."
1_1185,1_1185_u,0.0,"  I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric. If by ""eccentric"" you mean passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole, I agree. I think tonight was a very good start."
2_79,2_79_u,0.0,"  Oh, great. Although I did sit down where there wasn't a chair. By the way, Ross dropped by a box of your stuff. Oh, well, I guess I had that one coming. I'm just gonna throw it out, it's probably just a bunch of shampoo and..."
1_10829,1_10829_u,1.0,"  You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump Leonard? Why say it? Yes! Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list. Well, good job. Now she hates me. Great. On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next."
2_393,2_393_u,0.0,"  I can't take it anymore. So you win, okay? Here! Pheebs?"
1_6165,1_6165_u,1.0,"  Okay, all right. That one was clever. Skeleton with phosphorous on a zip line. Come on out, merry pranksters. Take a bow. You should've seen your face. Yes, there's nothing quite like the slightly widened eyes of mildly startled."
1_2423,1_2423_u,0.0,"  Everybody's staring at me. Don't worry, they're more scared of you than you are of them. Unlikely. Here, what about this one for my nephew? A superb choice. Oh, great. Provided he has already read and is familiar with the reestablishment of the DC multiverse."
2_350,2_350_u,1.0,"  They are ain't here yet No, but they should be any minute You seem a little nervous. Oh you're sure I am Are you nervous cause you haven't met Michael's fiancee? No Rose, I am nervous because Sonny Bono gets elected mayor of Palm Springs, he is gonna make all the postmens wear leather bell bottoms and a fur vest."
2_347,2_347_u,0.0,"  Oh! Right. Umm, maybe that's because I didn't send him an invitation. Chandler! He's your father.  he should be at the wedding. I don't even know the man. Okay? We're not that close. I haven't seen him in years. Well what are you gonna do when he finds out he wasn't even asked?!"
1_10857,1_10857_u,0.0,"  Okay, sit down. Listen, Emily, what happened between me and Raj was a long time ago. It was, and I may have made it seem like a bigger deal than I should have. Yeah, and Leonard and I are engaged now, and I'm just hoping we can put this whole thing behind us. Mm. I'd like that, too. Yeah, I thought I'd be okay with it, but then I saw how pretty you are. Oh, that's so sweet.
I mean, look at you-- you are gorgeous. It's true-- you're both gorgeous. Kind of says something about the man who could bed you both."
1_11924,1_11924_u,1.0,"  So, I put stickers on everything we're gonna sell.
We just need help taking it all out to the driveway. Can I be in charge of pricing?
I've been going to garage sales my whole life. Can you believe I got these pantyhose for a nickel? All right, Amy's in charge of pricing and being 75."
1_S12E09_005,1_S12E09_005_u,1.0,"  Sheldon, do you want to put the tables after each section or in an appendix at the end? You know what? We wrote this paper together. I think we should decide together that they go in an appendix at the end. How about that? There is an ""I"" in ""team."""
2_128,2_128_u,1.0,"  Hey, we know how we always say we need a place for the mail? Well I started building one, but then, I decided to take it to the next step. You building a post office?"
1_1296,1_1296_u,1.0,"  They're going to digitally add a supernova.
They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent. Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself. Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen, I have to go to the bank with wire cutters."
1_S12E15_064,1_S12E15_064_u,1.0,"  (sighs) So, this week would have been my wedding if Anu and I hadn't decided to slow things down. Oh, yeah, I would have forgotten, except for those nonrefundable airline tickets to India I bought."
2_387,2_387_u,0.0,"  Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
1_12320,1_12320_u,0.0,"  Okay. Well, then it's settled: small indoor church wedding, black-tie, no butterflies. Sounds perfect. Great. You still didn't pick a date. Stay out of it! Shut up!

1_S11E04_162,1_S11E04_162_u,0.0,"  Oh. I should've brought peanuts. You can't eat peanuts. You're allergic. If you die, who's going to drive me home? I'm not gonna eat them. It's a thing they do at JPL. When the Ranger mission finally had a successful launch, there were peanuts in the room. Ever since then, they have them at every launch.

1_1722,1_1722_u,0.0,  What are you doing here? Hang on. 130 over 80. It's a little high. We can attribute that to the stress of sneaking past the security desk. Where did you get the stethoscope and the blood pressure cuff? My aunt Marion gave them to me for my 12th birthday.

1_7675,1_7675_u,0.0,"  Damn. Well, at least when we do make love, Sheldon won't be thinking about his mother. And yes, that is a cleverly veiled reference to Howard's lifelong obsession to crawl back into her spacious womb. Anyway, to this day, I still can't see a box of crayons without crossing my legs."

Then you never saw any other people?"
1_11201,1_11201_u,0.0,"  It's nice they're getting exercise. Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt. I'm sure he brought it. No, but last year, at Magic Mountain, he got such a bad sunburn, we had to cut him out of it. He probably got a new one. Finish your breakfast.

They're running tests-- I don't know. It may have been a heart attack or heart-attack-like event. What's the difference? A heart-attack-like event is an event that's like a heart attack. Thanks for clearing that up"
