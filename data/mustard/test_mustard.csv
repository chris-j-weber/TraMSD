1_S09E04_015,1_S09E04_015_u,0," Why are you taking your bins over there? That's just where I need them. You know, she doesn't have a lot of closet space. What's wrong with your closet? Uh... Well, honey, you know, now that Leonard and I are married, it kind of makes sense that we actually live together."
2_96,2_96_u,0," Y'know, y'know I'm lookin' and I don't think anyone's home here. I say we just break the window, crawl through, and-and y'know explain later. Yeah? Really? No one's home? I don't think so. Hello?  When you get in there"
1_2575,1_2575_u,0," This thing has to hold up against a hearty potato-based diet. I feel terrible Maybe if you were helping, you'd feel better about yourself. I deliberately tried to sabotage Stuart's date with Penny. Of course you feel terrible. You completely screwed up your karma. You don't really believe in that superstition, do you?"
1_11177,1_11177_u,1," Okay, why? I'm listening to you snore. I'm wondering how I'll ever sleep without it."
1_S12E03_095,1_S12E03_095_u,0," Wow, you really are good at this. Well, I'’ve spent a lot of time painting D&Dminiatures. I know that makes you want to rip my shirt off, but wait until your nails are dry. [PHONE CHIMES] Oh, it'’s Raj. He sent us that Indian marriage questionnaire."
2_457,2_457_u,1," I just don't wanna give them any more ammunition than they already have. Yes, we all know how cruel a parent can be, about the flatness of a child's pillow."
1_3371,1_3371_u,0," Thank you for driving me back to my hotel. Oh,it's not a problem. I was going to ask Leonard to do it, but he seemed a bit emotionally unstable and you don't want someone like that operating heavy machinery."
2_197,2_197_u,1," Did you call the cops? No, we took her to lunch Ah your own brand of vigilante justice."
2_303,2_303_u,1," Hey Chandler!, come on in we are knitting pot holders. No thanks Josephine!"
1_3660,1_3660_u,1," Leonard, what do the two of you talk about after the coitus? My guess is, ""Hey, four minutes! New record!"" That's why I'm the funny one. Anyway, we followed the guy to this garage sale, and they had the coolest stuff. They were closing up. We got this whole box for 60 bucks. We didn't even get to go through it all. There could be anything in here. There a new girlfriend in there? 'Cause you might need one."
1_S09E01_368,1_S09E01_368_u,1," I asked you over and over if you were okay. Why would you go through with the wedding if you weren't? I thought I was okay, but it turns out I'm not. Okay, listen, I may not have been entirely faithful, but you, you are not easy to lift! Wow! Well, marriage must agree with you. Well, you are just glowing."
1_S10E04_043,1_S10E04_043_u,0," Cohabitation with my girlfriend? That's a great deal to process. Mm. It's only for five weeks. Yeah, and we'll be right across the hall. What do you think? I don't know. What if living together kills the romance?"
1_6183,1_6183_u,0," It is, isn't it? (gasps) Oh, bother. Isn't that just always the way? 
You go to staple something, and you're out of staples. Gosh, I wish I'd known that earlier today when I was at Staples. You have a thing of paper clips right there."
2_581,2_581_u,1," Quack quack, quack quack, quack quack. We were wondering what was taking so long with the gift, but now we understand you were doing this."
1_S11E21_201,1_S11E21_201_u,1," We can have date night another night. But you got all dressed up. We were supposed to have dinner and romance. We'll just have to divide and conquer. I'll go to dinner, and you can stay home with the Internet and have romance."
1_S10E17_125,1_S10E17_125_u,1," Yeah, you're a grown man who's highly educated. You could charge people money to punch you."
1_S09E04_382,1_S09E04_382_u,0," LEONARD: Buddy, I know me moving in with Penny feels like a big change, but it's not. How can you say that? Amy's gone, and you two are married now, so it's only a matter of time before you're gone, too."
2_357,2_357_u,1," Yes. Great, let's begin.  How's the pressure? Nice! Wow Phoebe you are good! Stating the obvious, but thank you. And it's not weird is it."
2_226,2_226_u,1," Could guys please try to keep It down? We are trying to start a tournament. These people find out that a spelling game is going over there, there will be nobody left at our party."
1_S09E22_015,1_S09E22_015_u,1," All right, well, let me know if you guys want to go. I would love to. I do enjoy the complexity of an aged Pinot noir. I'm sure that would pair nicely with your fried nuggets of chicken."
1_9668,1_9668_u,0," We'll come back to that one. This brings us to the final item in our annual State of the Relationship Summit.
Item 29: Valentine's Day. Ah, the worst for last. Hmm. Classic Flakey. Before you get upset, I believe I've come up with a way for us to celebrate the occasion that we both can enjoy. People usually start a meeting with a joke, but you go ahead-- end with one."
1_S10E08_063,1_S10E08_063_u,1," I-I just found a wobble. Oh, do I need a mop? It's a gravitational wobble. It could be a sign of an extrasolar planet that may contain life and someday be named after me. Oh... well, if it has life, maybe it already has a name, huh? Yeah, but it's probably difficult to pronounce. What is your name? Rajesh Ramayan Koothrappali. You think it would be more difficult than that?"
2_30,2_30_u,0, Yeah. He could row like a viking. Hi. So how'd it go?
2_439,2_439_u,0," Y'know what I think it is? I think you've made such a nice home for her over the last nine months that she just doesn't want to leave. Oh. Look at you making up crap for me. Oh God! Twenty-one hours, you're a hero."
1_S12E12_266,1_S12E12_266_u,1," So listen, I got to be honest. We sort of have another reason for asking you here. We want to have a baby, but we can't do it on our own. It could be because of the game me and my frat brothers used to play where we kicked each other in the balls over and over. But the doc says there's no telling. We just don't know. Huh. You went to college."
1_S12E01_111,1_S12E01_111_u,0," Uh, hurry. Raj is on next. All right. I can't believe they canceled Vampire Diaries but they'll show this. This is the news. And that was a woman torn between two hunky vampires."

What's all this? I'm just boxing up all the clothes Halley's outgrown. Guess we won't need them anymore. Oh, well, slow down. I'm sure there's some you could reuse for a boy. ""Daddy's little girl""?"
1_S09E05_278,1_S09E05_278_u,0, How've you been? I'm doing all right. I tried fencing today.
2_8,2_8_u,0," I'm doing research for a book, and I was wondering what someone might do if they left a baby on a city bus. Hi, here's the deal. We lost a carseat on a bus today. It's white plastic, with a handle, and it fits onto a stroller."
1_4792,1_4792_u,0," I may have failed. Okay, I guess we just go without a Wonder Woman. I don't want to go without Penny. Oh, great. No Superman, no Wonder Woman? All we've got is a skinny Flash, an Indian Aquaman, a nearsighted Green Lantern, and a teeny, tiny Dark Knight. Obviously, we're no longer a Justice League. We have no choice but to switch to our Muppet Baby costumes."
1_7089,1_7089_u,1," after you had a snootful of this, laddie! Funny. You boys have a nice time? Yeah, it was great. Low-key, like I promised. 
No hanky-panky, no strippers.
Just the guys telling jokes. That's nice. How about you? Did you have a fun night?  Yeah, we, uh, made gift bags, had wine, and then went online and saw this."
1_8052,1_8052_u,1," I swear, that man is the most egotistical, insufferable human being I have ever met. Yeah, but you two make such a cute couple. Like Burt and Ernie. You guys even teach me stuff about words and numbers."
1_1296,1_1296_u,1," They're going to digitally add a supernova.
They say it's the perfect metaphor for my incandescent talent. Right, a ball of hot, flaming gas that collapses upon itself. Excuse me. Oh, it's my assistant, Trevor. Go for Koothrappali. They gave him an assistant? If I want a new pen, I have to go to the bank with wire cutters."
1_1478,1_1478_u,1," Did I miss anything? Did they kick Giselle off? Not yet, but her underwater photo shoot was an embarrassment. Sadly, Mrs. Giselle Wolowitz is sensitive to chlorine. Lucky for her I like my fashion models pruny and bug-eyed."
2_416,2_416_u,1, Ok it was just me and her at the back of the train and I sat at the door so she had to pass by me if she like to switch cars. She was totally at my mercy. Were you so late because you were burying this woman?
1_S10E04_177,1_S10E04_177_u,0," you and I are gonna be sharing a bed. You know, this is uncharted territory for both of us. How are you feeling about that? Oh, excited, concerned, a little scared. All the same emotions"
2_232,2_232_u,0," Oh, I'll go out and get you some. Really?! Nope! Because I'm not your boyfriend. Hey Pheebs, how did it go? Well, umm, my Mom's friend, Phoebe, is actually my birth Mom."
1_4760,1_4760_u,1," Wow, this place is awesome. Where do they keep the Archies? In the bedrooms of ten-year- old girls, where they belong."
2_475,2_475_u,1," Hey, Chan. Can you help me out here, I promise I'll pay you back. Oh yeah ok, including the waffles last week, you now owe me, seventeen zillion dollars."
2_137,2_137_u,0," But if you do, make sure it seems like you're there to see him, okay? And you're not, like, doing it as a favor to me. Okay, but If he asks, I am not going to lie."
1_6860,1_6860_u,0," You know, Sheldon, I used to cut my brother's hair. 
I could do it for you. Penny, I know you mean well, offering the skills of the hill folk, but, um, here in town, we don't churn our own butter, we don't make dresses out of gunny sacks, and, uh, we sure as shootin' don't get our hair cut by bottle-blonde... Sheldon, be nice. I'm sorry, it's the bad boy attitude that comes with this hair."
2_27,2_27_u,0," Yeah, Ross is great. He's uh, he's in a whole other place. No, he's gone. No no, you don't have to fly back, really."
2_141,2_141_u,1, He also found an M and an O. We think it was trying to spell out monkey.
1_S12E23_470,1_S12E23_470_u,1," Hydrogen. Carbon. Carbon. And last but not least, carbon. This might be the glue talking, but that was a very pleasurable 139 and a half hours."
1_2464,1_2464_u,1," Come on. I think it's nice that Captain Sweatpants showed up to your art opening. Yeah, it would have been nicer if he hadn't touched all the cheese. You know, it's kind of early.
Do you want to maybe come in for some coffee? Gee, it's a little late for coffee, isn't it? You think ""coffee,"" means coffee. That is so sweet."
1_3287,1_3287_u,1," I told my girlfriend Bernadette she could join us for dinner. Sure. The more, the merrier. Wa- no, that's a false equivalency. More does not equal merry. If there were 2,000 people in this apartment right now, would we be celebrating?
No, we'd be suffocating. Sheldon... Don't ""Sheldon"" me. We ordered for five people, not six. Oh, come on, it's fine. We'll just put it all on the table, you know, family style. Oh, sure. And while we're at it, why don't we put our hands behind our backs, have an old-fashioned eating contest?"
1_S11E22_069,1_S11E22_069_u,1," But while we're on the subject of fashion, I'm asking the university for some funding tomorrow. What should I wear? Mm. Well, I've got a push-up bra I can loan you that always gets me free drinks."
1_10829,1_10829_u,1," You would leave me out of the conversation with the next guy if you dump Leonard? Why say it? Yes! Well, I would never leave you off my list, and not just because, without you, we're playing fast and loose with the word list. Well, good job. Now she hates me. Great. On the bright side, that Oxford study was right. One friend down. I wonder who you're going to lose next."
2_387,2_387_u,0," Oh, uh, listen, about tonight... No, no, no, don't you dare bail on me. The only reason she's goin' out with me is because I said I could bring a friend for her friend. Yes, I know, but her friend sounds like such a..."
1_S12E06_248,1_S12E06_248_u,1, What do you think you're doing? I thought it was clear. I'm being unnecessarily hurtful but with a sweet voice. And I don't understand what's going on because I went to MIT.
1_S09E04_288,1_S09E04_288_u,1," Hey, if you're open to living with someone great, I'll give you $1,000 to take Stuart. You really should've gone on the Internet and checked how long that kind of thing lives"
3_S01E05_417,3_S01E05_417_u,1," Dude, relax, okay? We each ripped through a full module this morning. We're just taking a little break. DRM is now a thing of beauty. - Wait. You did DRM? - Yeah. I did DRM. Why did you do DRM? I said I would do DRM, you would do error handling. Anything to do with ""error"" sounds like your whole vibe."
1_S12E11_002,1_S12E11_002_u,1," Champagne, a champagne, a champagne with a packet of Splenda in it. - You know what I call this drink? - A waste of champagne?"
1_S10E02_123,1_S10E02_123_u,0," How did you think you were gonna hide your pregnancy? I had a plan-- I kept leaving Dove Bar wrappers around to explain any weight gain. Where did you get empty Dove Bar wrappers? From all the Dove Bars I ate! I'm pregnant! Try to keep up! I'm sorry. I-I have to go find out if my boss knows. Well, whatever happens, we're here for you. Thanks. You guys are the best. Yeah, drive safe. We love you. And give us a call... Oh, my God, it was me, it was me! I'm the one who blabbed she was pregnant!"
3_S01E03_249,3_S01E03_249_u,1," - Where's ERLICH? - He's outside with the intern. - What intern? - You got interns? We might as well have interns, we hire illegal aliens."
3_S04E01_575,3_S04E01_575_u,1," Gilfoyle, can I please be CEO of Pied Piper? Spoken like a true leader. But since your failure as a leader is a virtual certainty, tolerating your short reign as CEO in exchange for a front-row seat to the disaster seems fair."
2_228,2_228_u,0," Hi Tag! Hey, so did you have fun with uh, with Joey last night? Oh yeah! We went to the Knicks game. Ohh that's nice. Then we went to this bar and he hooked us up with all these women!"
2_487,2_487_u,1," I can't take it any more! So you win, okay? Pheebs? Flying a jet? Better make it a spaceship so that you can get back to your home planet! And Ross, phone call for you today. Tom Jones, he wants his pants back! And Hornswoggle? What? Are you dating a character from ""Fraggle Rock""? Ahh."
1_S09E20_127,1_S09E20_127_u,1," You feel like raj is getting a little carried away With all the baby stuff? I don't think so. He just wants to be part of the experience. All right, if you say so. What's in the box? Oh, it's an ultrasonic microphone So we can hear the baby's heartbeat. Oh. That's cool. Can we try it? Actually, raj ordered it. He made me promise to wait till he was here. So he can be... Part of the experience? Yeah. I'm surprised he let us conceive without him."
2_550,2_550_u,1," I will have one. Okay, I'm not gonna have one. No, no, it's just my tooth. All right I'll have one."
1_2669,1_2669_u,0," What time is it? It's 7:00 a.m. I'm sorry it's early, but we're leaving soon, and I needed to talk to you. What did you mean when you said you were going to miss me?"

1_971,1_971_u,1," Take that! What's the matter? This granola bar has peanuts in it! Oh, my God. Why did you eat it? I don't know. It was just there! If I had a gun there, would you have shot yourself? Don't yell at me! I've got to go to the emergency room! - Now?! - No, after my tongue has swollen to the size of a brisket!"
2_289,2_289_u,1," Do you know what just happened? Yeah. We-we had sex and then we fell asleep. No. We were in the middle of sex .. and Nooo! No, that's not true. No, best time ever! Yeah, you rocked my world!"
1_1189,1_1189_u,0," That's enough. Call me. Right. Okay, good night. What? Had a great time. Ciao. I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair."
3_S05E02_072,3_S05E02_072_u,1," That's odd. You left before me. How was I able to park before you? I guess all 50 of the new employees decided to show up bright and early for the fucking all-hands meeting. I had to park on level five. Huh! So unlike you, the world understands  that I'm saving the planet and has rewarded me with...(clicks tongue) primo spot. Congratulations. You've finally taken your rightful spot amongst the handicapped."
2_13,2_13_u,0," Rachel, I have not missed one question the whole game. I own this game! Look at my hand. Why? Do you have the answers written on there? No! Steady as a rock! Now, are you with me. All right, let's do it."

2_373,2_373_u,1, Where the hell have you been? I was making a coconut phone with a professor.
3_S02E05_179,3_S02E05_179_u,0," So Gavin Belson can just pick up the phone and make us radioactive to every single web-hosting service? It's how these guys operate. I mean, when Bill Gates got married on Lanai, he rented every helicopter on the Hawaiian islands so that paparazzi couldn't use them to fly over. Although in that case, it was a positive, because now you can imagine that wedding however you want. What? Dinesh: Jared? Our entire platform is web-based. We need servers for that. What the fuck are we going to do? I know what the fuck we're going to do. But you're not going to like it. We build our own servers."
3_S02E04_395,3_S02E04_395_u,0," Okay, that was the third reference she's made to how much money she's making. Hmm. That's a $3500 bag. How do you know? You have the same one? No, I have the fucking Internet. You don't think she's making more money than us, do you? No, we all have equalized pay, remember?"
2_351,2_351_u,1," Now PERSON is depressed Rose. Do you think she is depressed about Rebecca No Rose, she is depressed because Marvel had manners on only once a week"
1_S12E18_159,1_S12E18_159_u,1," Hey. Kids asleep? Nope. I've been trying to get them down for hours. Apparently, Halley's afraid of the dark now and I can't turn on the night-light cause it makes Michael cry. Why doesn't he like the night-light? Jot that down, we can ask him as soon as he learns to speak. We can also find out what's so damn funny about birds. I'll go talk to her. I don't know why she's suddenly so afraid of everything. Honey, remember, she's my child, too."
2_494,2_494_u,1," I know Richard's really nice and everything, it's just that we don't know him really well you know, plus he is old  ...  er than some people. But younger than some buildings!"
1_5166,1_5166_u,1," but the driver didn't look at all like the photograph on his license, so I leapt out and ran for it. Wise. There you go. Just like recovering alcoholics drink in the Caribbean. Hi, bestie. Oh. Hi, Amy. How you been? Fine. From this angle, I can see up your nose. Yeah, it's a great time to be alive, isn't it?"
1_S12E04_102,1_S12E04_102_u,0," I still can't believe Sheldon had a best friend we've never heard about. Ooh, somebody's jealous. - I'm not jealous. - Leonard, this is a safe space-- it's okay to be vulnerable."

1_S12E05_054,1_S12E05_054_u,0," So I'm gonna place the sensory isolation helmet on you for about five minutes. All you need to do is sit still and relax. What do I do if I start to get claustrophobic? Oh, the helmet will sense that and stop the experiment."
3_S03E01_431,3_S03E01_431_u,1," - You wrote some of it. - You know what? We're gonna stay, and we're gonna build Pied Piper just to prove you wrong. Okay. Thank you for the solidarity by the way, and sticking with your friend. You know what, ERLICH? You can tell Barker to go fuck himself, so I can go to Flutterbeam and then watch these two assholes crash and burn trying to build out Pied Piper by themselves. This'll be great. (SIGHS) Great timing, guys. Thank you so much. Premium stuff, Dinesh."
1_S12E07_105,1_S12E07_105_u,1," - What's going on? - Well, Siebert put me in charge of handing out the last bit of the administrative funds, and I have sole discretion. Ooh! Looks like Christmas came early. First thing on my list is a golden umbrella, cause Leonard's gonna make it rain! Uh, hold on, I'm not just gonna hand out money. There's a procedure you need to follow. I believe he's referring to the traditional ""kissing of the buttocks."" Should we form a line, or just do it like we're bobbing for apples?"
2_423,2_423_u,1," Richard! Actually, I'm not here to complement the chef. Ohh ..  Oh, that's okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef. Like I have nothing better to do!"
1_11901,1_11901_u,1," I don't believe it matters what the topic is. What's crucial for a salon is that we conduct the discussion in an elevated and insightful way. 
It's all about the execution. Of course you'd focus on that rather than the inspiration. Uh, new salon topic.
What's more important, an idea or its execution? Oh, that's fun. Yeah, good for you, Leonard. That's a lovely little notion. Kind of like, I wish I could talk to my uncle in Chicago. Yeah, now stand back while I invent the telephone. Hello? Oh, hold on. Leonard, it's your uncle. He says you just got burned."
1_4145,1_4145_u,1, And this is a schematic for a bird-trapping device that will ultimately backfire and cause me physical injury? What I'm doing here is trying to determine when I'm going to die. A lot of people are working on that research. So what is all this?
2_188,2_188_u,0," I just saw Danny getting on the subway with a girl and he had his arm around her. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Well, you should be, this is all your fault! You meddled in our relationship!! You had no relationship!!"
1_S12E07_443,1_S12E07_443_u,0," The europium laser is so cool. It has a four-level f-f transition which provides for high power output, and its quantum efficiency is off the charts. What are you going to use it for? I have no idea."
3_S02E02_081,3_S02E02_081_u,1," Things are just really different at Raviga, and I had nothing to do with the decision. Guys, I'm so, so sorry. Wait, so the company that offered us the most until Richard talked them into offering us the least is now offering us nothing? But the fact that you're so sorry makes it all better."
1_11051,1_11051_u,0," Ooh.
He was so happy after he passed it, he gave me a Terminator. That is amazing.
How long have you been collecting? Ever since I was a kid, but, uh, I didn't really get serious until William Shatner's bladder infection. What'd you get? What'd you get? Well, he said it was a tribble. It could be a toupee, but either way, it's pretty cool."
